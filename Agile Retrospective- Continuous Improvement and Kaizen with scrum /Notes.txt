Sprint Retrospective :
It is a way to look back at things and find effective solutions to any problems that your sprint may suffer from. It form a key to the continuous improved aimed by an agile sprint.
A sprint retrospective is nothing but a meeting facilitated by the scrum master of the team. It involve discussion on the ongoing process of the team and what could be done to make the next sprint better and effective. It facilitates continuous improvement of the sprint by helping the team to effectively integrate feedback into sprint management.

Some of the main issue addressed in a print retrospective are
	•	What went well?
	•	What wen wrong?
	•	What could be done for improvement?

Key elements of a good retrospective
	•	At least one aspect of the team, sprint or process undergoes improvement discussion in a retrospective. Every sprint ends with a bunch of improvements to make sure sprints are undergoing continuous improvement.
	•	A retrospective is not a responsibility of a single person. It is a collaborated effort that includes the whole team, product owner and the scrum master.
	•	All team members are involved in identifying the good things that happens over the sprint and things that could be improved.
	•	Healthy discussions make healthy retrospective. The team members are able to put down their views and suggestions for improvement without any hesitation or negative emotions.
	•	Ideas to improve productivity and efficiency are brainstormed and their implementation is analysed.


Tips 1-7 
Example : How to Run a Sprint Retrospective

It is a time box meeting which lies the agile principle of inspect and adapt. In this meeting team focus on what worked in the sprint and what could be improved.
Ask 2 Questions from the team
What worked during the last sprint?
What could be improved in the next sprint?
Each member should speak one at a time so that rest of the team can hear clearly. The meeting needs to be time boxed strictly as usual, but should be long enough to allow the team space to express themselves.
If the amount of absenteeism in the sprint its a key blocker, nobody should feel negative about saying so.

	•	Ensure extra time for actions of priority items that need improvement or resolution
	•	maintain a backlog, check all priority items and allot them to the team during sprint planning

	•	The value of the improvement should always be discussed with stakeholders to show them that it is a good decision for the buisness
	•	A certain amount of buffer (as discussed with product owner) should be left in release plan for such improvements.

Tip 27 - Go by a Retrospective Pattern

  5 stages
1. Set the stage - This can be a brief introduction to the purpose of the meeting
2. Collect the data -  This is where your team must look for answers. However you must be very much time conscious about it as you would be in a sprint. You need to know what happend in previous sprints and collect such data (usually verbally). You must know what you could be wanting from it. As mentioned in one of our sprints, you should record notes from retrospective that you can use further.
3. Create insights - Deciding on the data collected, you must be comprehensive about what you have learnt and suggest what it says about future improvements.
4. Decide what to do and what could be done - Later you must decide what actions could be taken to ensure that the granted insights are materialised efficiently.
5.Close

	•	There must be a pattern for everything that what we do, as it ensures maximum success rate.
	•	Though changes could be added to retrospective, it is vital to follow the basic pattern of a retrospective
	•	Try the five steps of the pattern of the retrospective and ensure you do it in time
	•	Try the 3 ordered steps  of a roundtable retrospective and see if it works for you 

Tip 28 - One at a Time
	•	Focus is one of the most important criteria for success and shouldn’t be hampered by too many improvement ideas in one sprint 
	•	 There is no point listing a number of actions and improvements to be made in a sprint if they interfere with each other 
	•	It is always better for the team to focus on one single improvement in one sprint and complete it in situations such as these

Tip 29 - Improve how you capture Visible Notes

	•	Just like all other things in a retrospective, it is important to pay attention the note making as well.
	•	Use wide chisel tip marker to write and ensure you get rid of all the permanent markers on white boards
	•	Write large on the board as it is easy to read that way. Use mixed sentence cases instead of capital letters as it is more comprehensive
