 Scrum Fundamentals for Scrum Master and Agile Products

Scrum is a process framework used to manage product development and other knowledge work
Scrum is a set of rules for structuring the team, processes and techniques for making the development process agile.

4 component of scrum framework
	•	Scrum Team
	•	Scrum rules
	•	Scrum Events
	•	Scrum Artifacts (list of the things to be done)

Three Pillars of Scrum:
	▪	Transparency - Required information is available and flows properly
	▪	Inspection - Regular monitoring for early detection of issue
	▪	Adaptation - course correction to prevent further deviation

Scrum Team
Product Owner
Development Team
Scrum master (ensure proper practical implementation of all concepts)

Product owner
Responsibility:
	•	Maximise the total value of work done by the development team
	•	Product backlog management
	•	Organisation also provides authority to product owner

Development Team
Responsibility:
	•	Deliver a potentially releasable product at the end of each Sprint
Authority
	•	how the work would be done is left to the development team

Characteristics of scrum development team
	•	It is cross-functional, no external dependency
	•	it is self-organizing
	•	No titles and sub teams within the development team
	•	Team size: A team of 3 to 9 team members is good

Scrum Master
Responsibility
	•	Ensure proper practical implementation of all concepts
	•	All scrum related things such as maintaining the product backlog, helping the development team create high value products etc
	•	Facilitating Scrum Events
	•	Ensure Scrum Artifacts are properly maintained
	•	Single point of contact to understand scrum

Scrum Events
	•	Sprint
	•	Sprint Planning
	•	Daily Scrum
	•	Sprint Review
	•	Sprint Retrospective

Feature of scrum events
	•	Regular: Events can be monthly/weekly/daily
	•	Time boxed: limit on the duration of these events. Daily scrum is 15 minute meeting
	•	Based on 3 pill of transparency, inspection and adaptation.


Scrum Events 1: Sprint
Period of x days 
After x days product increment and then released

Scrum Event 2 : Sprint Planning
	•	Sprint planning happens once in each sprint
	•	Entire scrum team : product owner, scrum master & development team must be a part of the event
	•	Time box for the event is 8 hours (upper limit)
	•	Two agendas
   1) what is to be done in this sprint
    2) Establish how it will be done

What is to be done?
Team velocity : how much work development was  able to do in th previous few sprints
Estimation Poker 

How it will be done?
Plan is not fixed, it evolve as more clarity increases
Development team will come up with the plan

Scrum Event 3:daily Scrum
Daily scrum is a 15-minute event done everyday, same place, same time
	•	Event is primary for the development team
	•	Scrum Master facilitates the event
	•	Product owner can attend the event(not necessary)
	•	Daily scrum is implementation of two pillars of scrum: Regular inspection & early adaptation

3 important Question in daily scrum 
	•	what did I do yesterday?
	•	What will I do today?
	•	any difficulties or impediments stopping me from the sprint goal?

Scrum Event 4: Sprint Review
Attendees
	•	Entire Scrum Team : Product owner, scrum master, the development team & other stakeholder

Objective
	•	Help the scrum team work more effectively
	•	Increase transparency within the team and between other stakeholder and scrum team
Time box for the event is 4 hours or less

What happens in Sprint Review?
	1)	Product Owner invites all attendees
	2)	Product Owner highlights completed & not completed items
	3)	Development team share sprint experience, highlight challenges Development team demonstrates completed item Stakeholders may ask question on the demonstrated item
	4)	Product owner opens the backlog & intiate discussion on what to do next. Priorities, budgets, timelines & capabilities etc. are discussed
	5)	At the end of sprint review, product owner should have updated backlog


Scrum Event 5: Sprint Retrospective
Scrum team does this event
Stakeholders not invited
3 hours or less duration

Agenda

Inspect the performance of team
What went well?
What went wrong?

At the end of scrum retrospective, scrum team should know:
	•	Area of improvements
	•	Plan of working on them

Scrum Artifacts
There are 3:
	1)	Product Backlog
	2)	Sprint Backlog
	3)	Increment

Scrum Artifact 1:Product Backlog:
At initial stage starting of the process we make list of all requirement at that time

As a later stage when requirement change(Ever Evolving) (NeverFixed)
—> add details to new requirements
Backlog Refinement <=10% of the capacity of development team

Scrum Artifact 2:Sprint Backlog
Daily monitoring of sprint backlog is done in the daily scrum
Owned by development team
Any deviation from the goal should be highlighted to product owner and stockholder immediately.

Scrum Artifact 3:Increment
Increment is the final releasable product
	•	It should be useable
	•	It should be inspectable
	•	It should include increment of previous sprint
Definition of “Done” 

Advantages and Disadvantages of Scrum:
Advantages of scrum:
	•	More transparency and project visibility
	•	Increased team accountability
	•	Easy to accommodate changes
	•	Increased cost savings
	•	Faster Delivery
	•	Customers are heard

	•	Disadvantages of Scrum:
	•	Risk of scope creep
	•	Team requires experience and commitment
	•	The wrong scrum master can ruin everything
	•	Poorly defined tasks can lead to inaccuracies

Burn Down Chart
A burndown chart is a visual display display of work completed and remaining in a project, sprint or iteration
Benefits
	•	Simple & easy way to track team’s progress
	•	Timely prevention of issues
	•	Helps keep the team motivated

Minimum viable Product (MVP)
It is the version of new product that allows a team to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about customers with the least amount of effort.
Use Case:
Your target audience needs a specific means of transport but they are not sure if the want to buy a premium product away.
What you do then?
Create the most basic version of the product —> gather feedback of your product
Why MVP?
	•	release a product to the market as quickly as possible
	•	test an idea with real user before committing a large budget to the product’s full development.
	•	learn what resonates with the company’s target market and what doesn’t
Important Point to be noted:
	•	make sue your planned MVP align with your business objectives
	•	Identify specific problems you want to solve for your users
	•	product must be viable
	•	MVP is based on iterative processs of building
Eg airbnb , Facebook, virgin airline

Velocity
At the end of each iteration, the team adds up effort estimates associated with user stories that were completed during the iteration. This total is called velocity.
Velocity = units of work completed in a given timeframe
Work =unit of work can be hours or user stories or story points
Timeframe = Typically measured in iteartion or sprint or weak
Sprint 1 velocity = 11
Sprint 2 velocity = 13
Sprint 3 velocity = 6
Average velocity = (11+13+6)/3 = 10 story Points/Sprint
 Total story points against Remaining is 60
So 60/10=6 sprints

Estimation in Agile
For reasonable guess, you estimate basis what you know or see

Traditional estimation.                            Agile Estimation   
Efforts were estimated			      Business values or complexity is estimated
Unit:Hours					     Units : Story Point or bucket
Estimation is done in task level		     Estimation is done in user story level
Provides absolute estimate		      provide relative estimate
Estimates once done are not Revised.    Estimation are revised in every iteration.

Influencing factors of Story point:
	•	Buisness value
	•	Complexity
	•	Risks Dependencies
	•	Amount of work

Small - 1 point 
Medium - 2-3 Point
Large - 5 point
Extra large - 8 point
Fibonacci Sequence
1, 2, 3 is equivalent to 10, 20, 30
0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89…. And so on
0+1=1
1+1=2
1+2=3
In agile estimation, slightly modified version of Fibonacci estimation is used
1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,89…and so on.
Why Use the Fibonacci sequence for agile estimation?
(Stories building example)
Story points are relative.
1. Quick to deliver and minimal complexity. An hour
2. Quick to deliver and some complexity . Multiple hours
3. Moderate time to deliver, moderate complexity, possible unknowns
5. Longer time to deliver, high complexity, likely unknowns
8. Long time to deliver, high complexity, critical unknowns
13. Long time to delivery, high complexity , many critical unknowns
21. You’re doing this wrong
